# UFOs

One drawback of the webpage is that the database has to be manually updated. This can cause delays in the researcher looking for up to date data. If someone is looking for information on an UFO that happened recently in their area, it could take weeks for that information to be uploaded into the new data.js file. 

One recommendation for this would be to have frequent updates on this database as long as the HTTP is active. 

Another recommendation would be to have multiple databases feed into this database to have more up to date information.
